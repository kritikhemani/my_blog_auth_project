# üìù Blog+Auth Database Core


## Introduction

This repository contains the Database Core for a modern blogging and user authentication application.

The project is built on Python and leverages SQLAlchemy 2.0, utilizing the Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) to define a clean, relational schema and implement robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This foundation ensures secure user management and efficient content handling, providing a reliable backend for a scalable blog platform.

## Key Technologies Used:

    Python: The core programming language.

    SQLAlchemy 2.0: Used for declarative ORM modeling and modern database interaction.

    SQLite: Used for the development database (can easily be swapped for PostgreSQL or MySQL).

    passlib[bcrypt]: For secure, one-way password hashing.
